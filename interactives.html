  <h2>Split Communities: Jacksonville Neighborhoods Map</h2>
  <p>
    Explore how Jacksonville City Council’s redistricting plan splits 47 neighborhoods across multiple districts—often dividing communities and weakening their political power. This interactive map lets you see which neighborhoods are split and how district lines cross community boundaries, using the city’s official neighborhood definitions. Based on reporting by The Tributary, the tool visualizes concerns about racial gerrymandering, diluted representation, and the challenges residents face when their communities are carved up. Click on any neighborhood to see how it’s divided, who represents it, and why advocates say the lines matter.
